# Prediction of Product Sales 
## üìã Overview

This project focuses on predicting product sales using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help the retailer understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in increasing sales, optimize inventory, and improve decision-making based on data-driven insights.

  - From the product side, factors such as fat content, item type, visibilit, and product weight are analyzed to understand their influence on sales.
  - From the outlet side, attributes like outlet size, location, and type are considered to capture differences in consumer behavior across different store settings.
By combining these two dimensions, the project provides insights into what drives higher sales and offers a tool to forecast sales more accurately

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze sales data to identify trends and key factors influencing sales.

- Build and evaluate predictive models to forecast future product sales.

- Provide actionable insights through visualizations and performance metrics.

## üìà Results

**Model Results**

Regression Metrics: Test Data
------------------------------------------------------------
- MAE = 765.671
- MSE = 1,213,934.180
- RMSE = 1,101.787
- R^2 = 0.560
RandomForest model
------------------------------------------------------------
- MAE = 734.606
- MSE = 1,118,768.607
- RMSE = 1,057.719
- R^2 = 0.594

- Hyperparameter tuning reduced overfitting and improved generalization performance.
  
**Identified key predictors of product sales** 
- The OutletType is the most significant factor influencing sales performance
- Item Type Fruits and Vegetables gerates the highest Sales

## üìà Feature Importance & Coefficients Visualization

To understand which variables most influence product sales, feature importance and coefficients were visualized from the models.

The plot above displays the top coefficients from the **Linear Regression** model.  
These coefficients represent how much each feature affects the predicted sales ‚Äî  
positive values **increase** the prediction, while negative ones **decrease** it.

The chart above highlights the most influential features identified by the **Random Forest Regressor**.  
Feature importance measures how much each variable contributed to reducing prediction error during training.

















Generated interpretable insights for business decision-making
## To prepare this data, the data was cleaned, and the following processes were performed:

### Exploratory Data Analysis
    - During the exploratory data analysis, a boxplot and histogram was visualized for each numeric datatype column. 
    - Also, a countplot was visualized for each categorical column. 
    - This gave a good baseline for all of the numeric and categorical columns for univariate EDA.

    for example the item wight 12.5 is the most frequent weight for the items
